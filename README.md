# API Formatter
This is a product that lets you call multiple APIs at the cost of one.
API formatter introduces a new layer between APIs and user making multiple calls faster and data structured

## Example
! Asuming each call takes n seconds and the processing layer takes no time
### Direct Call
![slow](https://github.com/rishiCz/api-formatter/assets/98217604/838dc174-cb4d-4ada-82c5-95a185ec87f7)
#### The conventional method takes the sum of all the time taken by each api to get the data

#### The introduction to the processing layer reduces the time to only the largest time taken by an API from the list
#### Additionally the data returned is structured and in a single object
